# Secure Election

This is a demonstration of how a secure election module can
be built with two central facilities. A test program can be found
in the `SecureElectionClient` class.

## Run

Start the `CentralLegitimizationAgency` and `CentralTabulatingFacility`,
and then the `SecureElectionClient`.
